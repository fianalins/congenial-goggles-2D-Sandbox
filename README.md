# congenial-goggles-2D-Sandbox
A simple 2D sandbox with simple physics and a GitHub generated name

## What this is
This is a sandbox with a physics engine all in one html file.

## What it contains
4 simple shapes,

1. Circle
2. Square
3. Rectangle
4. Triangle

properties for the objects,

1. Mass
2. Size
3. Bounciness
4. Friction

and 4 different tools.

1. Weld Toggle
2. Unweld Toggle
3. Delete Toggle
4. Clear all

## What it is for
To see how to code in something other than Lua and Flixel for once.

## Controls
Controls are as simple as can be.

F - Freezes/unfreezes objects while being held/selected
Left MB - Drags objects, selects them

## Bugs, kind of
Some bugs that I'm too lazy to figure out (for now maybe)

### Selecting Objects
Sometimes, when deselecting an object (mainly when clicking in whitespace, haven't had it happen when clicking a different object), the object previously selected will stay highlighted, but not actually selected.

To remove the highlight, click the object again.

### Frozen Objects
Sometimes, when freezing an object, then selecting a different object, the frozen object will stay highlighted green even though it is not selected.

To fix this, click the object again, then it will return to blue.

### Wall Borders
Probably due to the way I made it, the walls don't scale properly when pressing the maximize button.

This works fine with resizing the window normally.
