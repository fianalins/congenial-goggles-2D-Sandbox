1. Mass
2. Size

and 4 different tools.

## What it is for
To see how to code in something other than Lua and Flixel for once.

## Controls
Controls are as simple as can be.

F - Freezes/unfreezes objects while being held/selected
Left MB - Drags objects, selects them

## Bugs, kind of
Does not affect gameplay

### Selecting Objects
Sometimes, when deselecting an object (mainly when clicking in whitespace, haven't had it happen when clicking a different object), the object previously selected will stay highlighted, but not actually selected.

To remove the highlight, click the object again.

### Frozen Objects
Sometimes, when freezing an object, then selecting a different object, the frozen object will stay highlighted green even though it is not selected.

To fix this, click the object again, then it will return to blue.
